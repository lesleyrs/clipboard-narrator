# clipboard-narrator
Turn any web page into an audiobook, works in the background on desktop!

Based on: https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/pull/744

I made this for myself to save me from doing more reading than needed, but I think it's a good tool anyone can make use of. Thx to [bruvzg](https://github.com/bruvzg) for making it possible! :+1:

Web build will spam for clipboard access as it's required to work currently.

PC build is recommended as it'll be able to read from clipboard in the background. No internet connection needed.

Current problems are comments in `main.gd`, but it's completely functional.
